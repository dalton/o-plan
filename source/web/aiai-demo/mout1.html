<p>
This demonstration allows you to run an O-Plan planning and execution
agent and interact with it through a COA evaluation matrix. The main 
features of the demonstration are summarized below. A password is required.

<p>
This is an initial demonstration of plan generation, execution monitoring
and plan repair for Small Unit Operations (SUO) forces performing Military
Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT). The SUO forces are equipped with a
Situation Awareness System (SAS) which includes a Planning and Decision Aid 
(PDA) which is intended to assist them in generating, refining, selecting,
communicating, executing and repairing plans across multiple echelons.

<p>
When you're ready to begin, press the "Begin" button below.  O-Plan
will continue running until the Task Assigner selects "Exit" or
"Restart" from the menu bar at the top of the main page or until
there has been no interaction for too long a time.

<!-- What's Cool? -->

This demonstration illustrates plan generation, execution monitoring
and plan repair. It includes:

<ul>
<li> Generation of alternative COAs under different initial assumptions;
<li> En route replanning to deal with dynamic situations;
<li> Plan execution tracking to deal with failures or unexpected events;
<li> Considered plan repair during the low tempo phase of the mission;
<li> Fast plan repair during the high tempo phase of the mission;
<li> Consideration of interfaces to target SUO/SAS environment.
</ul>
