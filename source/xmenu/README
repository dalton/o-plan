XMenu - provide a popup menu from a shell script etc.

This little toolkit program produces a popup menu on the screen taking
the command line arguments as menu entries.  If an argument contains
a non-escaped '=' (equals sign) the string to the left is the name
displayed in the menu and the string to the right is the text output
when this menu button is pressed.  If no equals sign is given the name of
the menu button is output.

A special argument "line" can be used to draw a dividing line between
successive menu entries.

A menu title can be given as an argument after a "-heading" flag.

The menu is only popped down when a menu button is pressed.
By default the menu is popped up below and to the right of the current
pointer position, use "-geometry" to position the menu at a particular
point (and in a particular size). 

Examples:

xmenu -heading "Choose Files by Suffix" Compressed="*.Z" \
		"C sources"="*.c" "Headers"="*.h" \
		line line "        Cancel"
 
xmenu Hello="Hello World" line " " " " line Goodbye="Goodbye World"
