<h1>Pacifica COA help</h1>

<b>Disaster strikes Pacifica (again)!</b>

<p>
Your task is to help the injured in some of the outlying cities of
Pacifica -- Abyss, Barnacle, and Calypso -- either by taking a medical
team to the city or by evacuating the injured to the capital, Delta.

A <A HREF="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/gif/pacifica-map.gif">
  map of Pacifica</A>
is available.

<p> The initial page, which you have already seen, allowed you to
define the prevailing conditions that apply to all courses of action
(COAs).  In the future, it will be possible to vary those conditions
when defining COAs; but at present, it is not.

<p>
Your present task is to examine a number of different COAs by
populating an evaluation matrix in which columns represent COAs
and rows represent evaluations (measurements) that can be applied
to plans.  Once you have developed a plan for a COA, the evaluation
entries in that COA's column are filled in.

<p>
The matrix contains some entries that have not yet been described.
The leftmost column contains row descriptions.  The top three rows
and the bottom row contain links that can be used to define
a COA, to give the O-Plan planner authority to plan for the COA, to
ask O-Plan to find a plan for the COA, and to view the resulting
plan.  Commands are issued by selecting these links.  For example,
to define COA-1, select the link labeled "COA-1".

<p>
Above the evaluation matrix are some other links that correspond
to other commands.  For instance, you selected the "Help" link
in order to reach this page.  The most important of these links
is "New COA" which adds a column to the matrix.
