<H1>O-Plan Web demonstration outputs</H1>

<P>
A range of different outputs can be produced by the O-Plan Web demos.
This document provides a brief explanation.

<H2><A NAME="O-Plan">O-Plan, tasks, and plans</A></H2>

First, something about what O-Plan does.
The <A HREF="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/">O-Plan home page</A>
may also be consulted.

<H3>Tasks and plans</H3>

<P>
O-Plan is given a <I>task</I>, and it produces a <I>plan</I>.
The task specifies <I>actions</I> to be carried out or <I>conditions</I>
to be achieved.  Since conditions are achieved by actions that
have the required effects, both aspects of the task result in
actions being added to the plan.

<P>
The plans that O-Plan produces are hierarchical, partially-ordered
networks of actions.  They're hierarchical because some actions are
broken down (<I>expanded</I>) into subactions.  They're partially
ordered because actions don't always have to occur in sequence.
Sequencing is added only when it's needed.  For instance, if I'm
going to go to work, I have to eat breakfast and get dressed first;
but I could eat breakfast and get dressed in either order, and I
might eat breakfast and read the paper at the same time.  

<P>
Note that it's only the latter case - actions that could be happening
at the same time - that can remain unordered.  For actions that could
happen in either order, a valid plan will have them in one order or
the other; but both plans will be possible.

<H3>Conditions and effects</H3>

An action has conditions and effects.  Conditions and effects have
the form

<PRE>
   <I>pattern = value</I>
</PRE>

for instance

<PRE>
   {on a b} = true
   {size a} = 10
   {distance_between a b} = 3
   {location jeff} = work
   {breakfast_eaten} = true
</PRE>

<P> 
If we imagine the actions of a plan taking place in time, then at
any given time the <I>state of the world</I> at that time can be
described as a list of <I>pattern = value</I> pairs, or <I>p-v-pairs</I>.
If <I>p=v</I> is such a pair, we might say <I>p</I> has value <I>v</I>
or perhaps that <I>p=v</I> is true.  (Don't confuse this with the
case where <I>v</I> is <TT>true</TT>.)  The pairs are sometimes 
called <I>facts</I>.

<P>
An action's conditions describe what values certain patterns must
have before the action can occur.  An action's effects describe
changes in pattern values.

<P> 
Every condition in the plan must have at least one matching effect
that (a) occurs at an earlier point in time, and (b) cannot be
canceled by any intervening effect.  This ensures that the required
condition is true.  When a condition depends on an effect in this
way, the dependency is recorded in a table known as the GOST
(for GOal STructure).

<P>
O-Plan does not explicitly track the state of the world.  Instead,
it records effects and when they occur in another table called the
TOME (Table Of Multiple Effects).  From this, and from information
about when actions take place, it's possible to determine at least
part of the state of the world at a given time, <I>t</I>.  It may
not be possible to determine the entire state at <I>t</I>, because
it may not be known whether certain effects must happen before
<I>t</I> or not.

<P>
For instance, suppose I'm traveling to Edinburgh on a train that
will arrive between 10 and 11 at night and that we're using effects
to record my position.  (Forget about whether we could actually
know the arrival time that precisely, given all the things that can 
go wrong.)  We can represent this in a plan.  The travel-to-Edinburgh
action would have an end-point that is listed as being between 10 and
11, and there'd be an effect at that point such as

<PRE>
  {location jeff} = Edinburgh
</PRE>

Now supppse we ask for the state of the world at 10:30.  Am I
in Edinburgh or not?  The answer is that we can't say, because
there's nothing in the plan that tells us.  In the plan, I
<I>could</I> be in Edinburgh by 10:30, but I am not <I>definitely</I>
in Edinburgh until 11.  

<!--
Therefore, if you ask for the state of the world at 10:30, that
state will not include {location jeff} = Edinburgh.  Presumably
it won't include include {location jeff} = London or = train
either.  Is that right?  Have to test...
-->


<H3>Time points and node-ends</H3>

It's time to say more precisely how actions, points in time,
and so forth, are represented in a plan.  We've already said that
a plan is a network of actions, and we've mentioned some data
structures, the TOME and GOST.  Now we're going to say more about
the network, and about time.  Our aim is to reach a point where
we can present a worked-out example.


<! -- 
/\/: time points, dummy nodes, state of world not always completely
clear because not known whether certain actions have definitely
started or finished.

<H3>Postscript graph</H3>

<IMG SRC="image/get-to-work-graph.gif">

<P>A PostScript graph of the nodes and links in the plan.  In order to
simplify the graph, dummy nodes that can be removed without increasing
the number of links have been removed, as have redundant links.
However, all of the necessary order-relationships are preserved.

<P>When possible, both ends of a node are shown as a single block.
This happens when links do not enter or leave "between the ends", i.e.
when links go only <EM>to</EM> the <EM>begin</EM>-half
of the node or <EM>from</EM> the <EM>end</EM>-half.

<H3>Narrative</H3>

One possible execution trace of the plan.

<H3>KP trace</H3>

The output produced by the KP-1 Knowledge Platform while the planner
is constructing a plan.  It shows each the planner followed when
finding the plan.  (This is not available in all demos.)

<P>
Requesting a KP trace will substantially slow the planner.

<H3>World-1</H3>

The state of the world, or <I>world view</I>, at the end of node-1
<I>as seen by conditions</I>.  Remember that the conditions at a given
point (node-end) are infinitesimally before the effects at the same
point.  So this world-view does not show the effects that happen at
the end of node-1.  All you'll normally see are the "always" facts.
However, some tasks, such as those in blocks-1, place their initial
facts as effects at the beginning of node-1, and those effects
<I>will</I> be seen.

<P>
The format is:
<PRE>
  world
    pattern_1 = value_1
    pattern_2 = value_2
    ...
  end_world
</PRE>

<H3>World-2</H3>

The world view at the end of node-2.  By convention, this is the final
state after the completion of the plan, and although difficulties
analogous to those of World-1 are possible in theory, they
never actually arise.  The format is the same as that of World-1.
