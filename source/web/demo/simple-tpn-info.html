<H2><A NAME="tpn">The TPN</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="inputs">Demonstration inputs</A></H2>

The input specifies points and constraints, with optional minimum
and maximum values, plus default minimum and maximum values.


<H3>Ranges</H3>

A minimum value is a positive integer.
A maximum value is a positive integer or the symbol "<B>inf</B>".
A min and max together specify a <I>range</I> with lower and
upper bounds.  An <B>inf</B> effectively means there is no upper bound.

In point and constraint specifications, a range is written like this:

<PRE>
   <I>min</I> <I>max</I>
</PRE>

If only one value is given, it is taken as both the <I>min</I> and 
the <I>max</I>.  If no value is given, the default <I>min</I> and
<I>max</I> are used.


<H3>Points</H3>

A point is specified like this:

<PRE>
   <I>name</I> <I>min</I> <I>max</I>
</PRE>

The <I>min</I> and <I>max</I> give the initial range of the point;
the point's range may become narrower when constraints are added
to the net.

<P>
In the area for entering points, you can write a sequence of point
specifications separated by commas.  The commas are optional.  A
reasonable approach is to include the commas only when more than
one point is described on the same line.  Here's an example:

<PRE>
   a 0 100
   b, c
</PRE>

This gives <B>a</B> an initial range of 0 to 100.  The other points,
<B>b</B> and <B>c</B>, get the default range.


<H3>Constraints</H3>

As with points, you can write a sequence of constraint specifications
separated by commas, and the commas are optional.

<P>
Constraints can be specified in two ways.  The first is similar to
the notation for points:

<PRE>
   <I>name1</I> <I>min</I> <I>max</I> <I>name2</I>
</PRE>

This says that the point <I>name1</I> must be before the point
<I>name2</I> and specifies a minimum and maximum distance between
them.

<P>
The second notation is more complex, but it makes it easy to
specify common combinations of constraints.

<H2><A NAME="outputs">Demonstration outputs</A></H2>

A number of different outputs are available:

<UL>
<LI><B>Description of the inputs</B>
<LI><B>Graphs</B>
    <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="#tpn-graph">Graph with constraints shown as links</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#con-graph">Graph with constraints shown as intermediate
        nodes</A>
    </UL>
<LI><B>Tables</B>
    <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="#point-table">Table of initial and final point values</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#points-in-context">Table of points in context</A>
    </UL>
</UL>

We'll desribe the outputs with the aid of an example.

It's the example that's already in the form when you first see it.
So if you were to select "Go" without changing the form, the outputs
below are what you'd get.  If you've forgotten what the form
contained, don't worry: the inputs are reproduced in the first
section of output.

<P>
All output is returned in an HTML document.  Some items appear directly
in the document; others are reached via links.  The output begins
with an identification of the O-Plan version:

<PRE>
O-Plan version 2.2+
Release date: 19-Apr-95
Build date:   19-Apr-95
</PRE>

The rest of the output matches the sequence of sections below.
Buttons in the input form let you select which parts you wish
to receive.

<P>
Note that in the output, min and max values are often written with
two dots between them:
<PRE>
  <I>min</I><B>..</B><I>max</I>.
</PRE>

That is the notation normally used in O-Plan, but the dots are
not used (and indeed are not allowed) in the demonstration input.
Using spaces instead of dots should make the input easier to type.


<H3>Description of the inputs</H3>

<PRE>
<B>Defaults:</B>
Points: 0 to inf.
Constraints: 10 to 20.

<B>Point input:</B>
a 0 100

<B>Constraint input:</B>
&lt;a,[b,c,d],e&gt;
&lt;e,[f,g]&gt;

<B>Points as parsed:</B>
  (a 0 100)

<B>Constraints as parsed:</B>
  (:sequence a 10 20 (:parallel b c d) 10 20 e)
  (:sequence e 10 20 (:parallel f g))

<B>Expanded constraints:</B>
  a 10..20 b
  a 10..20 c
  a 10..20 d
  b 10..20 e
  c 10..20 e
  d 10..20 e
  e 10..20 f
  e 10..20 g

<B>Success!</B>
</PRE>

<P>
This section shows how the point and constraint descriptions are
processed.  First, they're converted to lists by a simple 
recursive-descent parser.  The parser also fills in default
min and max values when no range has been supplied.  Next, the
sequential / parallel constraint notation is expanded to produce
a list of individual constraints, and any points that are mentioned
only in the constraints are given the default min and max values.

<P>
The final step is to construct the TPN.  This is done by adding all
the points and then adding constraints one at a time from the list
of expanded constraints.  "<B>Success!</B>" indicates that all the
constraints could be added.  If some constraint could not be added,
a "<B>Failure</B>" message is printed instead.

<P>
For example, suppose we had the following constraints instead of the
ones above:

<PRE>
<B>Constraint input:</B>
&lt;a,b,a,c&gt;

<B>Expanded constraints:</B>
  a 10..20 b
  b 10..20 a
  a 10..20 c
</PRE>

Note that this says <B>a</B> must be before <B>b</B> and that <B>b</B>
must be before <B>a</B>, an impossibility; so the second constraint
cannot be added to the net:

<PRE>
<B>Failure:</B> cannot add constraint (b a 10 20).

<B>Dropped constraints:</B>
  b 10..20 a
  a 10..20 c
</PRE>

Net constructions stops after the first failure.  There's no attempt
to add later constructions, even if they could be added consistently.
The TPN is managed in a way that would let us continue, if we wanted
to, but the results may be easier to understand if we stop.  In any
case, all of the requested outputs will still be produced, based on
the net as built before the failure.


<H3><A NAME="tpn-graph"> Graph with constraints shown as links</A></H3>

<IMG SRC="image/tpn-graph.gif">

<P>
The boxes represent time-points.  Each box contains the name of the
corresponding point and the final min and max values of that point.
If the min and max values are the same, only one number is displayed.

<P>
The lines between boxes represent constraints.  Constraints "point"
to the right, so boxes further to the right are later in time.


<H3><A NAME="con-graph">
    Graph with constraints shown as intermediate nodes</A>
</H3>

<IMG SRC="image/tpn-constraints.gif">

<P>
As in the previous graph, the boxes represent time-points, and each box
contains the name of the corresponding point above the final min and max
values of that point.  If the min and max values are the same, only
one number is listed.  Points that are later in time are drawn
further to the right.

<P>
Constraints are drawn as smaller boxes containing only min and max
values.  As with points, when the min and max are equal, only one
number is shown.  The box for a constraint between two points is 
connected by lines to the two points.  For instance, there's a
constraint that says <B>a</B> must be before <B>b</B>, with a
distance of 10 to 20 units between them.  This is drawn as a small
"<B>10 20</B>" box between the boxes for <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>.


<H3><A NAME="point-table">Initial and final point values</A></H3>

<PRE>
   <B>Alphabetical order </B>    <B>Increasing final min time</B>

   <B>a</B>   0..100   0..100    <B>a</B>   0..100        
   <B>b</B>   0..inf  10..120    <B>b</B>  10..120        
   <B>c</B>   0..inf  10..120    <B>c</B>  10..120        
   <B>d</B>   0..inf  10..120    <B>d</B>  10..120        
   <B>e</B>   0..inf  20..140    <B>e</B>  20..140        
   <B>f</B>   0..inf  30..160    <B>f</B>  30..160        
   <B>g</B>   0..inf  30..160    <B>g</B>  30..160        
</PRE>

This table is pretty much self-explanatory.  It shows the initial
and final range for each point.


<H3><A NAME="points-in-context">Points in context</A></H3>

<PRE>
                     <B>a= 0..100</B> 10.. 20 b=10..120
                     <B>a= 0..100</B> 10.. 20 c=10..120
                     <B>a= 0..100</B> 10.. 20 d=10..120

   a= 0..100 10.. 20 <B>b=10..120</B> 10.. 20 e=20..140

   a= 0..100 10.. 20 <B>c=10..120</B> 10.. 20 e=20..140

   a= 0..100 10.. 20 <B>d=10..120</B> 10.. 20 e=20..140

   b=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B> 10.. 20 f=30..160

   d=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B>

   e=20..140 10.. 20 <B>f=30..160</B>

   e=20..140 10.. 20 <B>g=30..160</B>
</PRE>

This table is similar to a KWIC (Key Words In Context) index.
Each point is shown together with the  constraints that directly
affect it, with the aim of making it easy to see that all the
constraints are satisfied.  In this table, points are always 
shown together with their range, like this:

<PRE>
   <I>name</I>=<I>min</I>..<I>max</I>
</PRE>

A constraint range is shown as

<PRE>
   <I>min</I>..<I>max</I>
</PRE>

On a given line of the table, the point in bold is the one being
shown "in context".  Constraints <I>from</I> earlier points are
shown to the left, constraints <I>to</I> later points are shown
to the right.  When both a <I>from</I> and a <I>to</I> constraint
appear on the same line, it is not significant.  Constraints are 
listed that way just to make the table more compact.

<P>
The remaining details are best explained by an example.  The point 
<B>e</B> will show the most.  Remember that the constraints were 
defined as follows, with a default range of 10 to 20:

<PRE>
   <B>Constraint input:</B>
   &lt;a,[b,c,d],e&gt;
   &lt;e,[f,g]&gt;
</PRE>

The constraints that directly involve <B>e</B> are therefore:

<PRE>
   b 10..20 e
   c 10..20 e
   d 10..20 e
   e 10..20 f
   e 10..20 g
</PRE>

The "points in context" table adds the ranges of all the points
and neatly lines things up:

<PRE>
   b=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B> 10.. 20 f=30..160
   c=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B> 10.. 20 g=30..160
   d=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B>
</PRE>

The aim is to make it fairly easy to see that <B>e</B>'s range satisfies
all of the constraints that involve <B>e</B>.  The rest of the table does
the same for the other points.

<P>
Here's the sort of check we can make.
Consider one constraint as it appears in the table:

<PRE>
   b=10..120 10.. 20 <B>e=20..140</B>
</PRE>

The constraint says that
point <B>e</B> must be at least 10 and at most 20 after <B>b</B>.
The earliest time for <B>b</B> is 10, so the earliest time for 
<B>e</B> must be at least 10 greater.  The actual value for <B>e</B>,
20, <I>is</I> at least 10 greater, so that part of the contraint is
satisfied.  Now consider latest times and the maximum distance 
allowed by the constraint.  The latest time for <B>b</B> is 120,
and the latest time for <B>e</B> can be at most 20 greater.
Again the actual value, 140, is ok.
