<p><a href="img/mout-col.gif">Initial situation:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;the action
takes place in the village of El McKenna. 17 Opposing Force (OPFOR) soldiers
are holding the local population as hostages in the
<a href="img/mout-col.gif">three central buildings</a> (32, 33 and 41).
A Small Unit Operations Company is to be sent in helicopters
to neutralise the OPFOR threat and free the civilians.

<hr>

<a href="img/mout-col.gif">Advance planning:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;the 
commander specifies the mission as three tasks to rescue the 
hostages from the three buildings. In this scenario the commander 
explores the use of different toehold buildings. The first COA is 
set up as follows:

<pre>
platoon_1  building_34  building_33    
platoon_2  building_21  building_32    
platoon_4  building_46  building_41          
</pre>

This takes too long (4 hours 10 minutes) since building 21 is large and
fortified.

<p><a href="img/mout-col.gif">COA-2</a> uses building 31 instead of 21 
as follows:

<pre>
platoon_1  building_34  building_33          
platoon_2  building_31  building_32          
platoon_4  building_46  building_41          
</pre>

This is fine: it takes 3 hours 35 minutes, leaving 25 minutes slack time
in case things go wrong. The three platoons set off for the landing zone 
in the helicopters.

<hr>

<a href="img/mout-col.gif">En-route replanning:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;during
the flight, the company commander is informed by the recon team
on the ground that OPFOR have been preparing booby traps in building 46.
The commander therefore generates a new COA to deal with this, using
building 42 instead:

<pre>
platoon_1  building_34  building_33          
platoon_2  building_31  building_32          
platoon_4  building_42  building_41          
</pre>

Start execution, show world state and explain it comes from the SAS.
Execute through to the point where they are all at their ORPs (at --:--).

Execute to the world event, show the world state,
repair choosing go_around for the minefield and 
cut_through for the wire. Cut_through is better since go_around is what OPFOR
want you to do.
