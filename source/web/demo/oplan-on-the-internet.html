<UL>

<LI> How to run an O-Plan agent remotely on the Internet and
communicate with it from a Common Lisp program.  (Source code
will be provided.)

<LI> How to control O-Plan from within the same Lisp image, 
effectively using O-Plan as a subroutine.

<LI> How to run O-Plan via the World-Wide Web's Common Gateway
Interface, e.g. by using HTML forms.

</UL>

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>
Although it has not been well-publicized, it has been possible
to run an O-Plan agent remotely on the Internet since at least
version 1.2.  Indeed, the O-Plan planning and execution agents
have always communicated in this way.  In version 1.2, the link
used Internet-domain sockets; version 2.0 introduced a simpler
mechanism based on <tt>rsh</tt>.

<P>
[Three-agent architecture.]

<P>
However, certain limitations have only gradually been removed.
The 1.2 execution agent could be used remotely, but not the planner,
because the built-in task-assigner occupied the communication
channels.  This limitation was removed in version 2.0.  In addition,
all of the agents needed to display windows and interact with a
user.  It wasn't possible to run O-Plan invisibly in the background,
and some things a program might want to access or control were
available only via the windows.  These problems are being addressed
in the current development version.

If you are familiar with

and the Web's

you may be able to guess how some parts of the demos work.
