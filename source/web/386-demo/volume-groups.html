This example has O-Plan produce a shell script for removing a
volume group.

<P>
To remove a volume group with the <TT>vgremove</TT> command, it is first
necessary to remove all logical volumes from the group and all
but one physical volume.  To remove a logical volume, it is
necessary to unmount any file system on it.

<P>
The volume group in the example is named vg0.  The logical and
physical volumes in the group have names lv1, lv2, ... and pv1, pv2,
...  respectively.  File systems have names fs1, fs2, ..., and we
assume that they are mounted on the corresponding logical volumes (fs1
on lv1, fs2 on lv2, and so on).
