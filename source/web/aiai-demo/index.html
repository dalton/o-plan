<h1>O-Plan Web Demonstrations</h1>


<P>
Welcome to the O-Plan web demonstration page.
By following links from this page, you can run O-Plan remotely over
the Internet and have it produce plans for tasks (problems) in a
number of different domains.  The resulting plans and other results
then become available via further links.  In some cases the
demonstrations allow you to develop a number of alternative plans
and compare them.

<p>The <a href="demo/output-formats.html">Web demo outputs</a>
page contains a brief introduction to O-Plan and an explanation
of some of the output formats.

<P>
We hope that you will help us to improve this demonstration facility
by telling us of any problems and suggesting anything you'd like to
see added or done differently.  You will therefore be offered a number
of opportunities to <A HREF="mailto:oplan@ed.ac.uk">mail a comment</A>.


<A NAME="demos">
<H2>The Demonstrations</H2>
</A>

There are three basic kinds: COA evaluation matrix interfaces, 
forms that let you specify tasks by filling in parameters,
and lists of predefined tasks from which you select.

<H3>COA Evaluation Matrices</H3>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="gpdt.cgi" target="_blank">Pacifica Disaster Relief</A>
    - Develop and Compare Multiple Options

<DD><p>Lets you construct several options to offer disaster
    relief on Pacifica.  This is a simpler version of the
    more interactive demonstration below and does not require a
    password.</p>

<p>Demonstration Notes
<ol>
<li>The matrix interface actively manages the current "workflow fringe"
across all options being developed.
<li>Colour background rows are the activities you can step though.
<li>White background rows provide information.
<li>Anything with a hyperlink can be tried at any stage.
</ol>

<H3>Task-defining Forms</H3>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="volume-groups.html">Unix Volume Groups</A>
<DD>Writes a Unix shell script for removing a disk volume group. 

<DT><A HREF="island-rescue.html">Pacifica Island Rescue - Non-combatant
     Evacuation Operations (NEO)</A>
<DD>A Pacifica evacuation planning task with parameters for city populations,
    the number of ground transports (GTs) available, ground transport capacity,
    the destination, and a time limit.

<!--
<DT><A HREF="tf-checker.html">O-Plan TF Syntax-checker</A>
<DD>Allows you to specify an arbitrary Task Formalism (TF) file
    by giving an HTTP URL.
-->

<DT><a href="web-service-demos/web-service-examples.html"
       target="_blank">Web Service Composition</a> -
    O-Plan and I-Plan
<DD>A set of modifiable demonstrations that apply O-Plan and the
<a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/ix/">I-X</a> planner,
 I-Plan, to web-service composition tasks.

</DL>


<H3>Predefined Tasks</H3>

A good place to begin is the <A HREF="standard-examples-guide.cgi">
hypertext version of the O-Plan Demonstration Guide</A>.
It describes a number of problem domains -- block-stacking,
house-building, space platform construction, Pacifica, etc. --
and contains links that let you apply O-Plan to tasks in
those domains.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="demo/output-formats.html">Web demo outputs</A>
<DD>A description of some of the output formats produced by the demos.
It includes an introduction to O-Plan and a demonstration of its own.

<DT>
<A HREF="standard-examples-guide.cgi">
The Hypertext O-Plan Demonstration Guide</A>
<DD>
Domain descriptions together with links that run O-Plan,
as described above.

<DT>
<A HREF="standard-examples.cgi">
Standard O-Plan Task Formalism (TF) Demonstrations
</A>
<DD>
A similar set of domains and tasks, as a plain itemized list.
Contains most of the example domains distributed with O-Plan.

<DT>
<A HREF="IFD-5-examples.cgi">
Air Campaign Planning - Workflow Planning Aid Demonstration
</A>
<DD>Workflow planning demonstrations.

<DT>
<A HREF="resource-examples.cgi">
Resource Demonstrations
</A>
<DD>Pacifica evacuation tasks with resource modelling.
