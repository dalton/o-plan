An example of password protection.

The server will require a user-name and password when it's asked
to access something in a directory that contains an .htaccess file
(including in subdirectories).  The 1st time this happens for a
given directory, the server will say something to the browser,
and the browser will ask the user for a user-name and password.
The browser will then repeat the request, passing along this new
information, and it will continue to supply the user-name and
password on subsequent requests for things in the same directory.
