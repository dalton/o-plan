<p>
This demonstration allows you to run an O-Plan planning agent and
interact with it through a COA evaluation matrix.  The main features
of the demonstration are summarized below.  A password is required.

<p>
In this demonstration, two user roles must be played: Task-Assigner
and Technical Planning Expert.  One user can elect to play both roles,
or two independent users (anywhere on the Web) can play one each.  
In the latter case, they must specify the same session name so that
they will both end up using the same instance of O-Plan.  The session
name is up to them, but it should be something that is easily
communicated and is likely to be unique.  It remains valid only until
both users have joined.  When one user plays both roles,
no session name is required.

<p>
When you're ready to begin, press the "Begin" button below.  O-Plan
will continue running until the Task-Assigner selects "Exit" or
"Restart" from the menu bar at the top of the main page or until
there has been no interaction for too long a time.

<!-- What's Cool? -->

This demonstration illustrates mixed-initiative interaction between a
task-assigner and a planning agent.  It includes:

<ul>
<li>support for users in two roles: task-assigner and technical
    planning expert;
<li>evaluation of multiple courses of action;
<li>exploration of separate options and sub-options;
<li>exploration of different initial assumptions;
<li>incremental task definition by adding constraints to a plan;
<li>authority setting to allow incremental plan refinement
    and mixed-initaive work;
<li>plan analysis facilities that produce evaluations in summary
    and detailed form;
<li>selection of the critical plan evaluations to be presented;
<li>management of the outstanding issues produced by planning or analysis
    to help in planning and coordination workflow;
<li>traffic light displays to indicate the nature and status of
    outstanding issues - green when all issues have been addressed,
    orange when there are warnings or notes to read, and red when
    further action may be required.
</ul>
