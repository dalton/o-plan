An example of password protection.

The URL for this directory is: 

http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/password-example/

The http server will require a user-name and password when it's asked
to access something in a directory that contains an .htaccess file
that contains certain "Auth" entries.  The protection also applies
to subdirectories.

The 1st time a user tries to access such a URL, the server will say
something to the browser, and the browser will ask the user for a
user-name and password.  The browser will then repeat the request,
passing along this new information, and it will continue to supply the
user-name and password on subsequent requests for things in the same
directory.

(Netscape 4, at least, seems to try the same user and password even
for completely separate directories, but you can retry and enter a
different user and password.)

Here's the .htaccess file for this directory:


AuthName secret
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /project/oplan/html/password-example/.htpasswd

<limit GET>
require user oplan
</limit>


It appears that more than one "require user" line may be specified
in a "limit" block, and then all of those user names can be used.

The password file, in this case called .htaccess, can also have
passwords for more than one user.

Here's the .htpasswd file:


oplan:NEI/T9G7hfTZ6


As you can see, the password is encrypted.

To create such a file, add a user, or change a password, use the
htpasswd program.  Unfortunately, it's in an obscure place.  I've
put a link to it in /project/oplan/bin; and so you can use:

/project/oplan/bin/htpasswd


Example:

todday$ /project/oplan/bin/htpasswd                   
Usage: htpasswd [-c] passwordfile username
The -c flag creates a new file.

todday$ /project/oplan/bin/htpasswd -c .htpasswd oplan
Adding password for oplan.
New password:
Re-type new password:


Note how running it with no arguments produces a message saying
what the arguments can be.  Omit the "-c" if the file already
exists and you want to modify it.
